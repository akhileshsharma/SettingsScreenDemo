# Android Settings Screen Demo app

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

This demo app creates a main screen with a button in the middle labeled 'View Settings'. 
When the user clicks the button they are taken to a second screen that has four toggle switch options (default off).
They are labled Option 1, Option 2, Option 3 and Option 4. The user can enable or disable the toggle switch
